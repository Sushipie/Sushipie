# Welcome to my GitHub profile! :octocat:

Hi there! I'm a software engineering student and a music producer. On my profile, you'll find a variety of projects that I'm working on or have worked on in the past.

## Projects

-   **Sad Machine:** This is a project that I'm currently working on. It's a discord bot with many features such as moderation, music, and other fun stuff, so you don't have to keep 20 different bots in your server.

## Skills

-   I know some JavaScript
-   Started learning Flutter
-   Proficient in version control using Git
-   Music production skills using FL Studio

## Contact

If you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to send me a message on GitHub or email me at [ahmad.thakur@outlook.com]. I'm always open to meeting new people and working on exciting projects!

Thanks for stopping by! :smile:
